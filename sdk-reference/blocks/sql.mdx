## Overview

The SQL codeblock in the Bismuth SDK provides a simple interface for interacting with a PostgreSQL database. It allows you to execute SQL queries, fetch results, and manage transactions easily.

## Basic Usage

To use the SQL storage, follow these steps:

1. Import the SQL class from the Bismuth SDK
2. Create an instance of the SQL class
3. Use the provided methods to execute queries and fetch results

Here's a simple example:

```python
from bismuth import SQL

# Create an SQL instance
sql = SQL("__DB_CONNECTION_STRING__")

# Execute a query
sql.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100))")

# Insert data
sql.execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (%s)", ["John Doe"])

# Fetch data
result = sql.fetchone("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s", ["John Doe"])
print(result)  # Outputs: (1, 'John Doe')
```

## Methods

The SQL class provides the following main methods:

- `execute(sql: str, params: Sequence[Any]|Mapping[str, Any] = {})`: Execute a SQL query without returning results
- `fetchone(sql: str, params: Sequence[Any]|Mapping[str, Any] = {}) -> Optional[tuple[Any, ...]]`: Execute a query and fetch a single row
- `fetchall(sql: str, params: Sequence[Any]|Mapping[str, Any] = {}) -> list[tuple[Any, ...]]`: Execute a query and fetch all rows
- `getconn() -> psycopg.Connection`: Get the underlying psycopg connection object

## Query Execution

You can execute any SQL query using the `execute` method:

```python
#SETUP
from bismuth import SQL
sql = SQL("__DB_CONNECTION_STRING__")
#BODY
# Create a table
sql.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE products (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        price DECIMAL(10, 2)
    )
""")

# Insert data
sql.execute(
    "INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (%s, %s)",
    ["Apple", 0.50]
)

# Update data
sql.execute(
    "UPDATE products SET price = %s WHERE name = %s",
    [0.75, "Apple"]
)

# Delete data
sql.execute("DELETE FROM products WHERE name = %s", ["Apple"])
```

## Transactions

The SQL class automatically manages transactions. Each query is executed within a transaction, which is committed if the query succeeds or rolled back if an exception occurs.

If you need to manage transactions manually, you can use the underlying psycopg connection:

```python
#SETUP
from bismuth import SQL
sql = SQL("__DB_CONNECTION_STRING__")
#BODY
conn = sql.getconn()
with conn.transaction():
    sql.execute("INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (%s, %s)", ["Orange", 0.75])
    sql.execute("INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (%s, %s)", ["Banana", 0.60])
```

## Fetching Data

To retrieve data, use the `fetchone` or `fetchall` methods:

```python
#SETUP
from bismuth import SQL
sql = SQL("__DB_CONNECTION_STRING__")
#BODY
# Fetch a single row
result = sql.fetchone("SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = %s", ["Apple"])
if result:
    print(f"Product: {result[1]}, Price: ${result[2]}")

# Fetch all rows
results = sql.fetchall("SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < %s", [1.00])
for row in results:
    print(f"Product: {row[1]}, Price: ${row[2]}")
```

## Error Handling

The SQL class doesn't do anything fancy with error handling. Anything psycopg2 can raise we can raise. For that reason you should handle potential exceptions as you would normally:

```python
#SETUP
from bismuth import SQL
sql = SQL("__DB_CONNECTION_STRING__")
#BODY
try:
    sql.execute("INSERT INTO non_existent_table (column) VALUES (%s)", ["value"])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Connection Management

The SQL class automatically manages the database connection. It uses the following connection parameters:

- For hosted environments: It connects to the managed service using the `BISMUTH_AUTH` environment variable as the password
- For local development: You can provide a custom PostgreSQL URI

```python
from bismuth import SQL

# For local development, use any PG URI
sql = SQL("postgresql://whatever:your@uri/is")
```

## Advanced Usage

For more advanced use cases, you can directly use the psycopg connection:

```python
#SETUP
from bismuth import SQL
sql = SQL("__DB_CONNECTION_STRING__")
#BODY
conn = sql.getconn()
with conn.cursor() as cur:
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM products")
    for record in cur:
        print(record)
```

This allows you to use all features provided by the psycopg library, such as prepared statements, cursors, and more.
