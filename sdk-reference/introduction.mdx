<Note>
  Our SDK is not required to use the programming agent. The agent knows about
  many common Python libraries and can help you build a wide range of software
  without it. We provide this SDK so the agent always has a set of concrete
  primitives that integrate directly with our cloud tooling without building
  from scratch all in the service of helping you quickly bootstrap your projects
  as you start out.
</Note>

## Welcome

Bismuth's SDK provides a set of 4 common cloud primitives that help you build complex software from scratch.

Those primitives are:

- A simple API wrapper: API
- A database: SQL
- Blob storage: BlobStorage
- Configuration storage: Configuration

These help you build high quality software faster without dealing with certain infrastructure tasks such as
setting up a database. Our agent also knows about them specifically, which can help you build even quicker!
