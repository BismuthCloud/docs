## Installing

Installing the Bismuth CLI is super simple. All you need to do is copy the command below and hit enter!

```bash
python3 -m pip install bismuthsdk && python3 -m bismuthsdk install-cli
```

That command will both install our SDK and use a conveince function we have there to install the cli.

Once the CLI is installed then all you need to do is auth with github, google or email and password.

<Note>
  Don't worry if you haven't created an account yet that can be taken care of
  during this step.
</Note>

```bash
biscli login
```

This will spit out a link and you can either copy and paste it in your browser or if your terminal of choice supports smart links pressing `CMD/CTRL` and clicking the link should open it for you.

## Importing Your Project

Once you're logged in all you need to do is locally go to an existing repo you want to work on, create a new project, or clone our sample repo where you can let Bismuth run wild for a bit.

The sample repo is located here.

Regardless of what you choose the next step is to import your repo into Bismuth.

```bash
biscli import .
```

If the repo has a github remote attached our CLI will see that and reccomend you import through the github flow. This is optional and requires installing our github app.

Assuming all goes well your repo will be imported to bismuth and will have a new origin you can push to `git push bismuth`. You will not often have to push to bismuth as changes made by the agent are automatically synced.

And that's it you're ready to work with Bismuth!
