## Welcome

Hey there, thanks for checking us out. The CLI is the main interface to help you build your software more easily with our tools.
Through the CLI you can chat with our agent and have it modify your projects or even create projects from scratch.

Beyond that it can help you manage projects imported into Bismuth as well as managing all of the tools we have available such as databases and blob storage.

## Next Steps

Take a look at the main quickstart which will walk you through everything from the CLI to the Agent and get you up and running being more productive building sofware with your very own programming agent.
