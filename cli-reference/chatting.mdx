<Note>
  Make sure you have the CLI installed, you're logged in and that you are in the
  git repo of a project you have imported into Bismuth. See `Installing and
  Importing` under `Setup` for details on how to that.

## Chatting

After you've imported a project either through GitHub or locally you can start a chat with Bismuth.
Bismuth is the programming agent that will help you build your projects quicker and handle things like refactors and documenting your codebase.

To chat with Bismuth run `biscli chat` in the root of your imported repo in your terminal.

The chat interface is a pretty standard TUI interface with a chatbox on the bottom. You can send messages of any length, but currently newlines are treated as enter and will send your message.

Bismuth is capable of answering questions about your codebase, adding new files, modifying existing files, adding documentation, updating dependencies

## Chat Commands

There are multiple `/` commands you can use that each do different things when working in the chat interface.

- `/exit` or `/quit` exits the chat (or you can press `ESC`)
- `/help` does something
- `/undo` reverts the last set of changes made by Bismuth locally. This is careful to avoid changes you yourself may have had in progress.
- `/docs` opens this documentation site in the default browser you have set.

## Writing Code

When you ask Bismuth to make changes or write new code you'll see a few things happen.

1. Bismuth will chat to you like normal and explain what they're going to do in your project to achieve what you've asked.
2. They'll periodically enter their code writing loop where they're writing code, checking it for errors making changes and so on just like you as a developer would do.
   Going through that loop you'll see various statuses as things are happening they look like, Thinking, Writing Code, Fixing Errors and so on.

   <Note>
     Bismuth does not currently execute code, but that is close to the top of
     the list of features we're working on. We do however currently verify
     correctness using other methods.

3. Finally, assuming Bismuth comes up with a viable solution to your problem you'll be asked to commit or reject the changes.

   Bismuth works directly on your repo alongside you proposing commits when it's
   solved your problem. You are free to code while it's working, but note changing
   files in the area of concern you've asked it to work on may be overwritten when
   it responds.
